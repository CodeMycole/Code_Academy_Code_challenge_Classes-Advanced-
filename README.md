# Code_Academy_Code_challenge_Classes-Advanced-
A copy of the last advanced coding challenge in Code Academy's Learn Python 3 Course. Object Oriented Programming. 

Here is the project overview:

You have created a robotics company which began with four-wheeled driving robots, but you are now expanding the technology to include bipedal robots. Since a lot of robotic logic already exists from the driving robot, we can modularize the robot class structure using object oriented programming concepts such as inheritance. These five advanced challenge problems will test your knowledge of classes and interactions between multiple classes.
